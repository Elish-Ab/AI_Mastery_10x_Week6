# Notebooks Directory

This folder contains the Jupyter notebooks for tasks 1 through 4 of the Credit Scoring Model project. Each notebook corresponds to a specific task in the development of the credit scoring model.

## Notebooks Overview

1. **Task2.ipynb**:  
   - **Exloratory Data Analysis**: In this notebook, we clean the dataset and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand patterns in transaction and customer behavior.
   
2. **Task3.ipynb**:  
   - **Feature Engineering**: Here, we create new features and transform the existing data to prepare it for model building. This includes encoding categorical features, scaling numerical data, and aggregating customer-level information.
   - **Model Building and Evaluation**: In this notebook, we train multiple machine learning models, such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, to predict credit risk. We evaluate these models using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC.

4. **Task4.ipynb**:  
   - **Model Tuning and Selection**: This notebook focuses on hyperparameter tuning and selecting the best-performing model based on cross-validation results. The selected model is optimized for better performance on the validation set.

## How to Use

1. Navigate to the root directory of the project:
   ```bash
   cd notebooks
